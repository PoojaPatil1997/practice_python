# Operatars in python(arithmatic operators(+,-,*,/,%,**),assignment operators(=,+=,-=,*=,%=,/=,**=),logical operaters(and,or,not),relational operators(>,<,>=,<=))

# arithmatic operations
# a=5
# b=2
 
# print (a+b)
# print(a-b) 
# print(a*b) 
# print( a/b)
# print(a%b)
# print (a ** b) #a^b


# relational operators
# a= 50
# b = 20
# print(a == b )
# print(a != b )
# print(a >= b )
# print(a <= b )
# print(a > b )
# print(a < b )

#logical operators
# a=50
# b=30
# print((a>b) and (b<a))
# print((a==b) or (b<a))
# print (not True)

# type conversion (conversion,casting) conversion phython do atomaticaly by interpriter castign we have to do 


# a = 1
# b=2.30
# sum = a+b # here a is int b is flot 
# print (sum) # here interpriter automaticly do conversion in flot


a= int ("2" )# 2 is string we casted in int 
b = 2.30 #b is flot
sum = a+b
print(sum)
